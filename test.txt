For years, Japan implemented an aggressively dovish monetary policy stance.
Bank of Japan rates were effectively pinned at 0% for decades.
Large-scale QE was standard practice, and a few years ago the BoJ switched to Yield Curve Control (YCC).

This was necessary as relentless QE purchases had led the BoJ to own >50% of the Japanese government bond market, and buying more bonds would seriously alter the functioning of the market. For days, there were basically no trades happening in the JGB market.

So to keep 10-year yields low, the Bank of Japan moved from targeting a quantity of bonds to buy (QE) to a qualitative measure (YCC).

It was a successful move: the charts below show how predictable the BoJ monetary policy was - front-end rates stuck at 0% for decades, and 10y JGBs constantly trading in the prescribed +/- 25 bps yield range for 6+ years.

Until today.
