Essentially, we want to boost our reading speed from maybe 100-200 wpm (depending on the material) to maybe 250-300 wpm by "forcing" our eyes and brain to process words and remove the need for our eyes to move along the lines of a text. With a fixated gaze, one is supposed to be able to read faster and less prone to be distracted.

## Workflow
1. Read commandline input for the text to process.
2. Break down sentences into words and show up in the terminal. (The original Spritz method involves coloring the `center of gravity` in the word)
3. Maintain a clear screen.
